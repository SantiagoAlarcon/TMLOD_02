    In the late summer of that year we lived in a house
    in a village that looked across the river and the plain to
    the mountains. In the bed of the river there were peb-
    bles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the

    long barrels of the guns covered with green branches
    and green leafy branches and vines laid over the trac-
